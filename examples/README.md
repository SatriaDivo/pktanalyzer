# Analyze existing PCAP file
python analyze_pcap.py

# Start live monitoring
python live_monitor.py

# Install with full features
pip install -e .[full]
```

## Understanding the Output

### Packet Capture

- **Total size**: Combined size of all packets
- **Average size**: Mean packet size in bytes

### Protocol Distribution
- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol packets
- **UDP**: User Datagram Protocol packets  
- **ICMP**: Internet Control Message Protocol
- **Other**: ARP, unknown protocols, etc.

### Top Talkers
- Source IP addresses generating most traffic
- Useful for identifying active hosts

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Analysis Workflow

```python
from pktanalyzer import capture_packets, analyze_packets, plot_protocol_distribution

# 1. Capture packets
packets = capture_packets(count=100, filter_str="ip")

# 2. Analyze traffic
stats = analyze_packets(packets)

# 3. Visualize results
plot_protocol_distribution(packets, save_path="analysis.png")
```

### Security Monitoring Workflow

```python
from pktanalyzer import capture_packets, SecurityAnalyzer

# 1. Capture traffic
packets = capture_packets(count=500, filter_str="tcp or udp")

# 2. Initialize security analyzer
security = SecurityAnalyzer()

# 3. Detect threats
syn_flood = security.detect_syn_flood(packets)
port_scan = security.detect_port_scan(packets)

# 4. Generate security report
if syn_flood['detected'] or port_scan['detected']:
    print("üö® Security threats detected!")
```

### Performance Monitoring Workflow

```python
from pktanalyzer import capture_packets, PacketAnalyzer

# 1. Capture performance data
packets = capture_packets(count=1000, timeout=120)

# 2. Analyze performance
analyzer = PacketAnalyzer()
bandwidth = analyzer.calculate_bandwidth(packets)
latency = analyzer.analyze_latency(packets)

# 3. Assess network health
health_score = analyzer.calculate_overall_health_score({
    'bandwidth': bandwidth,
    'latency': latency
})
```

## File Formats

### Input Formats
- **Live capture**: Direct from network interfaces
- **PCAP files**: Standard packet capture format
- **PCAPNG files**: Next-generation packet capture format

### Output Formats
- **PNG**: Charts and visualizations
- **HTML**: Comprehensive reports
- **JSON**: Data export and analysis results
- **CSV**: Tabular data export
- **TXT**: Log files and summaries

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Network Troubleshooting
```python
# Capture and analyze network issues
packets = capture_packets(count=200, filter_str="tcp")
analysis = analyze_packets(packets)

# Check for connection problems
failed_connections = filter_by_flags(packets, ['RST', 'FIN'])
print(f"Failed connections: {len(failed_connections)}")
```

### 2. Security Incident Response
```python
# Load suspicious traffic from file
packets = load_pcap("suspicious_traffic.pcap")

# Perform security analysis
security = SecurityAnalyzer()
threats = security.detect_all_threats(packets)

# Generate incident report
create_incident_report(packets, threats, "incident_report.html")
```

### 3. Bandwidth Monitoring
```python
# Monitor bandwidth usage
packets = capture_packets(count=1000, timeout=300)

# Analyze bandwidth by protocol
tcp_packets = filter_by_protocol(packets, 'TCP')
udp_packets = filter_by_protocol(packets, 'UDP')

tcp_bandwidth = calculate_protocol_bandwidth(tcp_packets)
udp_bandwidth = calculate_protocol_bandwidth(udp_packets)
```

### 4. Educational Network Analysis
```python
# Demonstrate protocol behaviors
packets = capture_packets(count=50, filter_str="icmp or dns")

# Show protocol distribution
plot_protocol_distribution(packets)

# Explain packet contents
for packet in packets[:5]:
    summary = summarize_packet(packet)
    print(f"Packet: {summary}")
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### Performance Tips
1. **Use appropriate filter strings** to capture only relevant traffic
2. **Limit packet count** for faster processing
3. **Use async capture** for real-time monitoring
4. **Process packets in batches** for large datasets

### Security Tips
1. **Run with minimal privileges** when possible
2. **Validate input files** before processing
3. **Use secure storage** for captured data
4. **Implement proper logging** for audit trails

### Troubleshooting
1. **Check admin privileges** for packet capture issues
2. **Verify network interfaces** are available
3. **Install dependencies** if import errors occur
4. **Check firewall settings** that might block capture

## Learning Path

1. **Start with basic_usage.py** to understand core concepts
2. **Explore advanced_analysis.py** for filtering and analysis
3. **Study security_analysis.py** for threat detection
4. **Master performance_monitoring.py** for network optimization
